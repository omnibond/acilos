Thank you for choosing to download Acilos, private social valet. We appreciate your support.

To get started using the app, there a few requirements and steps. You will need to install the following:

0) apt-get update
		This will update the package lists from the repositories

1) apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
   		Java (developed on 1.6 but later versions have been tested and work)

2) apt-get install apache2
		Apache

3) apt-get install php5
		PHP

4) apt-get install nodejs 
		NodeJS

5) sudo apt-get install curl
		curl

6) Composer - https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

7) download the Acilos tarball/source from https://github.com/omnibond/acilos

8) untar/install in a location so that the apache webroot points at acilos/src

9) from the acilos/src directory:

	php composer.phar self-update
	apt-get install php5-curl 
	php composer.phar install

		This will install any remaining dependencies

11) Go to main domain page (http://YourDomain.com/), and you will be taken to the credentials page where you can follow our walkthroughs on setting up developer apps and adding in their key/secrets to the credentials page. After that is done, you will be taken to login.php where you should log in normally with your account and begin using the app.

12) from the command line:

	sudo a2enmod rewrite

		This will turn on the apache rewrite rule

14) start apache and from the acilos/src directory:

	sudo sh start.sh

		This will set up the data mining cronjobs, the cronManager shell scripts, start elasticsearch, and give all subsequent files and folders permissions.
